Analysing M Dwarf Flare Activity:

This project as a whole aims to investigate the flaring activity on M dwarfs and potentially uncover links between the flaring activity and characteristics, and the properties of the star.
This may allow conclusions to be drawn on the internal convective structure and magnetic activity purely based on flare data.

Note: Be sure to use compatible library versions before running the code, as throughout the projects development, libraries had to be updated or rolled back to keep satisfy compatability requirements. The "Lepine 2013 Star Data Product.txt" file is the MRT file sourced from 'Lépine, S. et al. (2013) ‘A spectroscopic catalog of the brightest (j<9) M dwarfs in the Northern Sky,’ The Astronomical Journal, 145(4), p. 102. doi:10.1088/0004-6256/145/4/102'. This file should be downloaded to a readable file location that can be implemented in the python code.  

The '.ipynb' files can be directly downloaded and contain the code to perform either data processing or data analysis. The '.txt' files are the pure text of these files so it can be copied from github as desired.
