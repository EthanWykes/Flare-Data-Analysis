Analysing M Dwarf Flare Activity:

This project as a whole aims to investigate the flaring activity on M dwarfs and potentially uncover links between the flaring activity and characteristics, and the properties of the star.
This may allow conclusions to be drawn on the internal convective structure and magnetic activity purely based on flare data.

Note: Be sure to use compatible library versions before running the code, as throughout the projects development, libraries had to be updated or rolled back to keep satisfy compatability requirements.
